    <h1>Rent App</h1>

    <p>
      This app is to help people who normally struggle to find rooms to rent.
      The people we are targeting are students and Job seekers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students especially those who have to move because their school is far
      away. So then our app helps them to find rooms available closeby to the
      school premises.
    </p>

    <p>
      Job seekers who just moved to a new area because of their current Job or
      looking for new jobs. We are also going to help them find rooms close to
      their workplace.
    </p>
